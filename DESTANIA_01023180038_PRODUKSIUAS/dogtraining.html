          <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 14pt;text-decoration : underline">Have you ever given your dog a bone only to watch him head to the couch or outside in the garden to bury it? Many dogs like to hide things in safe places and often dogs are predisposed to bury items that belong to them, and sometimes items that do not. Discover four reasons why this behavior occurs, and how or if you should stop it. </h6>

         <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 22pt;">Instinct</h6>
          <h6>
     This behavior may have developed due to strong survival instincts inherited from the domesticated dogs' wild ancestors of wild dogs and the gray wolf. Food was not always the easiest to come by and to make the most of the food they had, these wild dogs would often bury the excess in the ground near their dens. The soil acts as a natural refrigerator by keeping the meal away from direct sunlight and the temperature of the earth decreases with the depth of the hole, keeping food fresher longer, so the animal can retrieve it later when nourishment is scarce.</h6>
       
         <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 22pt;text-decoration : underline">Breed</h6>
         <h6>
      There are several breeds that are more predisposed to digging and burying than others. A few of these breeds are Terriers, Dachshunds, Beagles, Basset Hounds and Miniature Schnauzers. Carin Terriers, for instance, were originally bred to chase and hunt small game, and they have maintained their excellent digging skills and their instinct to search. Since these breeds are bred specifically to dig, they may also have a heightened desire to save their resources, and therefore are more likely to bury bones.</h6>
         <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 22pt;text-decoration : underline">Boredom</h6>
         <h6>
      Dogs need stimulation and outlets for their energy every day and when humans do not provide it for them, they will find their own ways to occupy themselves. An example may be the fun game of stealing a tv remote and burying it to get your attention (an attention seeking behavior) and to add some variety to their routines.</h6>
      <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 22pt;text-decoration : underline">Anxiety</h6>
      <h6>
      Stress and anxiety can play a part in this behavior as well. Some dogs that are feeling anxious may bury items to calm themselves since digging is a self-soothing behavior. If a dog does not feel safe at the moment or in the area they are fed in, they may bury their food to eat in a more comfortable place or time. You may also see more of this behavior in multi-dog households, or among dogs that grew up in situations where they had scarce resources.</h6>

          <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;text-decoration : underline">Why is it important to learn how to train a puppy to lie down? Dogs use certain postures naturally as ways to signal intent. It’s helpful to understand what your puppy’s body language communicates. </h6>

         <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 19pt;">01</h6>
          <h6>
     Show your puppy his training reward of choice. It can be a favorite toy or consist of tiny smidgeons of a strong smelling treat. Remember that he should ONLY get these favorite rewards during training, so he’s more eager to interact.</h6>
       
          <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 19pt;">02</h6>
         <h6>
      Place your puppy in a “sit” position. Once he’s in a comfortable seated position and paying attention to you, give the command, “down.”</h6>
         <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 19pt;">03</h6>
         
         <h6>
      Hold his reward in front of his nose, and lower to the ground and slightly ahead of him, so that he must follow. For tiny pups, you can teach this on an elevated surface like a coffee table, and lower the treat/toy just below table level. </h6>
      
      <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 19pt;">04</h6>
         <h6>
      Once he’s in position, give him the reward. Praise!</h6>
      
       <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 19pt;">05</h6>
         <h6>
      Practice the behavior several times, so he understands the concept. Generally, it’s best to train in several short sessions of 10 minutes or so throughout the day, instead of one long marathon session that wears the pup out. </h6>
      
      <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 19pt;">06</h6>
         <h6>
      Remember that pups learn by making mistakes, so a mistake is just a chance for a do-over. End with success! Praise along with the treat or toy, and throw a puppy party to celebrate how smart he is. </h6>
      
        <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 19pt;">07</h6>
         <h6>
      After he’s learned to “down” from a sitting position, practice having him “down” from a standing start. </h6>

          <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 13pt;text-decoration : underline">The "stay" command is an essential basic dog command that all dogs should learn. Almost as important as coming when called, the stay cue can prevent your dog from getting involved in dangerous situations. </h6>

         <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 19pt;">Gather Supplies</h6>
          <h6>
     Before you begin, you'll want a dog collar, extra-long leash (15 to 30 feet if possible), and training treats that your dog loves. You can use this training on a dog that already knows the cues for sit and/or down.</h6>
       
          <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 19pt;">Prepare Your Dog</h6>
         <h6>
      lace the collar and extra-long leash on your dog. Eventually, you won't need the leash for the stay command, but it's helpful in the beginning in case your dog doesn't stay.</h6>
      
         <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 19pt;">Give The Command</h6>
         <h6>
      Tell your dog to sit or lie down. If your dog is excited or fidgety, you may have more success starting with your dog in the down position. Say “stay” in a firm, clear voice while holding one hand up, palm out (as if to motion "stop").</h6>
      
      <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 19pt;">Release and Repeat</h6>
         <h6>
      Release your dog from the command by saying “OK” and encouraging the dog to move. Instruct your dog tolie down again and praise it when she or he complies. Say "stay" again with the hand motion while taking a step or two back. </h6>
      
       <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 19pt;">Add More Time and Distractions</h6>
         <h6>
     Repeat this process five to six times, gradually taking more steps back and increasing the time period between “stay” and “OK.”  </h6>
      
      <h6 style="color: black; font-size: 19pt;">Problems and Proofing Behavior</h6>
         <h6>
      Do your training in an area without distractions. If you don't have a backyard, a busy park is not a good place for this training, because there are too many distractions for the dog to focus on your commands. </h6>
